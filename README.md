## 📊 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive set of terminal-based benchmarking tasks designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) across various capabilities:

- **Code Generation & Refinement** - Python function generation, bug fixing, and code explanation
- **Text Generation & Manipulation** - Creative writing, summarization, and paraphrasing
- **Reasoning & Logic** - Mathematical problem solving, logical deduction, and common sense reasoning
- **Information Retrieval & Q&A** - Fact retrieval and contextual question answering
- **Language Understanding** - Sentiment analysis, NER, and translation
- **Long-Context Processing** - Document summarization and complex question answering

## 🚀 Getting Started

### View the Full Documentation

The complete benchmarking tasks with detailed instructions, test cases, and evaluation criteria are available in:

**[📄 LLM_Benchmarking_Tasks.md](LLM_Benchmarking_Tasks.md)**

### Using the Benchmarks

Each task in the documentation includes:

1. **Objective** - What capability is being evaluated
2. **Instructions** - Clear task description for the LLM
3. **Test Cases** - Specific inputs and expected outputs
4. **Evaluation Criteria** - How to assess LLM performance
5. **Solution Strategies** - Guidance for human evaluators

### Task Categories

The benchmarks are organized into six main categories, each targeting different aspects of LLM capabilities:

1. **Code Generation & Refinement** - Evaluates programming ability
2. **Text Generation & Manipulation** - Tests creative and technical writing
3. **Reasoning & Logic** - Assesses problem-solving capabilities
4. **Information Retrieval & Q&A** - Measures knowledge access and comprehension
5. **Language Understanding & NLU** - Tests linguistic analysis skills
6. **Long-Context Understanding** - Evaluates handling of extended documents

## 🎯 Use Cases

These benchmarks are designed for:

- **Model Evaluation** - Systematic assessment of LLM capabilities
- **Comparative Analysis** - Benchmarking different models against standardized tasks
- **Research & Development** - Identifying strengths and weaknesses in LLM architectures
- **Quality Assurance** - Validating model performance before deployment
- **Terminal-Based Testing** - Reproducible evaluation in command-line environments
